## Project Objective
Create an entire ETL process in a database and a Power BI dashboard to utilize the Customer Data and achieve below goals:                                 
1. Analyze Customer Data at below levels: 
     a. Demographic
     b. Geographic
     c. Payment and Account Info
     d. Services
2. Study Churner Profile and identify areas for implementing marketing campaigns.
3. Identify a method to predict future churners.

## ETL Framework
Our framework uses below components:
1. CSV file - This is our source file
2. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) - We will use its inbuilt import wizard to transform and load the data
3. SQL Server Database - This is where our final data will be loaded and host our data warehouse, tables and views for final usage.

## Dataset Description
No. of rows=6419, No. of columns=32. The dataset consists of customer information of a telecom company like Customer_ID, Gender, Age, Married, State, Number_of_Referrals, Tenure_in_Months, Value_Deal, Phone_Service, Multiple_Lines, Internet_Service, Internet_Type, Online_Security, Online_Backup, Device_Protection_Plan, Premium_Support, Streaming_TV, Streaming_Movies, Streaming_Music, Unlimited_Data, Contract, Paperless_Billing, Payment_Method, Monthly_Charge, Total_Charges, Total_Refunds, Total_Extra_Data_Charges, Total_Long_Distance_Charges, Total_Revenue, Customer_Status, Churn_Category, Churn_Reason.

### Note: Please refer `Dataset` folder above for dataset.

## Project Workflow
### SQL (SSMS)
1. Created a new database `db_Churn` in SQL Server Management Studio, after connecting to server.
2. Imported our CSV file using `Import Flat File` in SSMS and modified the columns by checking Allow Nulls checkbox for every column except for Candidate_ID (Primary Key), and changing bit datatype to varchar50 datatype to avoid errors on importing.
3. After importing, performed data analysis using SQL queries.
4. Created a new table `prod_Churn` from our previous table `stg_Churn` by replacing NULL values by 'None' or 'No' values.
5. Created two views `vw_ChurnData' and 'vw_JoinData` to be used later in predictive analysis.
   ### Note: For Steps 3, 4 and 5, please refer to `SQL Queries` file above for all the queries used in data analysis.
### Power BI
6. Connected Power BI to our SQL Server and imported `prod_Churn` table into our Power Query Editor using Transform Data option.
7. Created a new custom column `Churn_Status` and changed the datatype to Whole Number.
   ```bash
   = if [Customer_Status] = "Churned" then 1 else 0
   ```
8. Created a new custom column `Monthly_Charge_Status`.
   ```bash
   = if [Monthly_Charge] < 20 then "<20"
     else if [Monthly_Charge] < 50 then "20-50"
     else if [Monthly_Charge] < 100 then "50-100"
     else ">100"
   ```
9. Created a new table `mapping_AgeGrp` by referencing the `prod_Churn` table and removed all other columns except Age column and removed duplicates from Age column.
10. Created a new custom column `Age_Group` in `mapping_AgeGrp` table.
    ```bash
    = if [Age] < 20 then "<20"
      else if [Age] < 35 then "20-35"
      else if [Age] < 50 then "35-50"
      else ">50"
    ```
11. Created a new custom column `AgeGrpSorting` in `mapping_AgeGrp` table and changed datatype to Whole Number.
    ```bash
    = if [Age_Group] = "<20" then 1
      else if [Age_Group] = "20-35" then 2
      else if [Age_Group] = "35-50" then 3
      else 4
    ```
12. Created a new table `mapping_TenureGrp` by referncing the `prod_Churn` table and removed all other columns except Tenure_in_Months column and removed duplicates.
13. Created a new custom column `Tenure_Group` in `mapping_TenureGrp` table.
    ```bash
    = if [Tenure_in_Months] < 6 then "< 6 Months"
      else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 12 then "6-12 Months"
      else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 18 then "12-18 Months"
      else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 24 then "18-24 Months"
      else ">= 24 Months"
    ```
14. Created a new custom column `TenureGrpSorting` in 'mapping_TenureGrp` table and changed the datatype to Whole Number.
    ```bash
     = if [Tenure_Group] = "< 6 Months" then 1
      else if [Tenure_Group] = "6-12 Months" then 2
      else if [Tenure_Group] = "12-18 Months" then 3
      else if [Tenure_Group] = "18-24 Months" then 4
      else 5
    ```
15. Created a new table `prod_Services` by referencing `prod_Churn` table and unpivoted the columns -  Phone_Service, Multiple_Lines, Internet_Service, Online_Security, Online_Backup, Device_Protection_Plan, Premium_Support, Streaming_TV, Streaming_Movies, Streaming_Music, Unlimited_Data, Paperless_Billing.
16. After transforming the data, data is loaded into the Power BI Desktop.
17. Created a new table `tbl_Measures` to store all the measures we will create.
18. Created a new measure `Total Customers` using DAX formula.
    ```bash
    Total Customers = COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])
    ```
19. Created a new measure `New Joiners` using DAX formula.
    ```bash
    New Joiners = CALCULATE(COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID]), prod_Churn[Customer_Status] = "Joined")
    ```
20. Created a new measure `Total Churn` using DAX formula.
    ```bash
    Total Churn = SUM(prod_Churn[Churn_Status])
    ```
21. Created a new measure `Churn Rate` using DAX formula.
    ```bash
    Churn Rate = [Total Churn] / [Total Customers]
    ```
22. Created a new measure `Percent of Row Total` using DAX formula.
    ```bash
    Percent of Row Total = 
     DIVIDE(
         SUM('prod_Services'[Churn_Status]),
     CALCULATE(
        SUM('prod_Services'[Churn_Status]),
     ALLEXCEPT('prod_Services', 'prod_Services'[Services])
      )
    )
    ```
23. Created a Power BI report `Churn Analysis - Summary` using various visualizations.
    ### Note: Please refer `Reports` folder above for reports pdf.
### Python (Jupyter Notebook)
23. Connected SQL database to Jupyter Notebook.
24. Performed predictive analytics using machine learning algorithm `Random Forest`.
25. Trained our model on `vw_ChurnData` view created earlier on Step 5 and achieved an accuracy of 84%.
26. Tested our model on `vw_JoinData` view created earlier on Step 5.
27. Exporting the `Predictions` table into the SQL database using `to_sql`.
    ### Note: Please refer `Jupyter Notebook` folder for detailed machine learning code.
## Power BI
28. Imported the `Predictions` table from SQL Server to Power BI.
29. Created a new measure `Count Predicted Churner` using DAX formula.
    ```bash
    Count Predicted Churner = COUNT(Predictions[Customer_ID]) + 0
    ```
30. Created a new measure `Title Predicted Churner` using DAX formula.
    ```bash
    Title Predicted Churner = "COUNT OF PREDICTED CHURNERS : " & COUNT(Predictions[Customer_ID])
    ```
31. Created a Power BI report `Churn Analysis - Prediction` using various visualizations.
